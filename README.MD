Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation engine that utilizes various data-driven approaches to improve user engagement and conversion rates on an e-commerce platform. This system is capable of recommending products based on user preferences, browsing history, and item characteristics.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Collection
The recommendation engine utilizes open-source e-commerce datasets, such as:
Amazon Product Reviews
MovieLens Dataset
Preprocessing Steps
Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and filter out noisy data.
Ensure data integrity by verifying the consistency of user and item identifiers.
Normalization and Encoding:

Normalize numerical features to ensure uniform scaling.
Encode categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to item descriptions to convert text data into numerical format.
Interaction Matrix:

Construct a user-item interaction matrix capturing user actions (e.g., add to cart) for collaborative filtering.
Model Development
Hybrid Recommendation System
Collaborative Filtering:

Implemented using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization. This captures latent user-item interactions to predict missing values in the interaction matrix.
Content-Based Filtering:

Utilized TF-IDF to generate item profiles based on text descriptions. Recommendations are made by matching user profiles to item profiles using cosine similarity.
Neural Collaborative Filtering:

Developed a deep learning model using PyTorch, called Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF). This model uses embeddings to represent users and items, and leverages a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn complex interaction patterns.
Model Architecture
Embedding Layers: Convert user and item IDs into dense vector representations.
Fully Connected Layers: Capture non-linear relationships between users and items.
Output Layer: Produces a predicted interaction score for user-item pairs.
Scalability and Performance
Caching Mechanisms:

Implement caching strategies to store frequently accessed recommendations and intermediate computations to reduce latency.
Distributed Computing:

Utilize distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark to process large-scale datasets efficiently.
Database Optimization:

Optimize database queries and indexing to improve the performance of data retrieval operations.
Evaluation and Optimization
Evaluation Metrics
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG): Measures the ranking quality of recommendations based on user relevance.
Mean Average Precision (MAP): Evaluates the precision of recommendations at various cutoff levels.
Conversion Rate: Tracks the effectiveness of recommendations in driving user actions.
Optimization Techniques
A/B Testing:

Implement A/B testing to compare different recommendation strategies and models in real-world scenarios.
Online Learning:

Use online learning techniques to continuously update the recommendation model based on new user interactions and feedback.
Continuous Evaluation:

Set up a pipeline to monitor model performance and automatically trigger retraining as needed.
Implementation Steps
Set Up Development Environment:

Install required packages and libraries using pip or conda.
Create Data Pipelines:

Develop scripts to automate data preprocessing, feature extraction, and dataset preparation.
Develop and Train the Model:

Implement training loops for the NCF model using PyTorch.
Train SVD and TF-IDF models using Scikit-learn.
Build an API for Serving Recommendations:

Develop a RESTful API using Flask or FastAPI to provide recommendations to users.
Implement Monitoring and Logging:

Set up tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system performance and log key metrics.
Set Up Continuous Evaluation and Retraining:

Design a system to periodically evaluate model performance and retrain the model based on updated data.
