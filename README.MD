AI-Powered Recommendation Engine for E-commerce
This project implements an AI-powered recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform using a combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning techniques.

Overview
The recommendation engine is designed to enhance user engagement and increase conversion rates by providing personalized product recommendations based on user preferences and item characteristics.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Datasets: Utilizes open-source e-commerce datasets such as product reviews and user interaction data.
Preprocessing: Involves cleaning data, handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding text data using TF-IDF. A user-item interaction matrix is constructed for collaborative filtering.
Model Development
Hybrid Recommendation System
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization to uncover latent user-item interactions and predict user preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Employs TF-IDF to convert product descriptions into numerical vectors, enabling the recommendation of items similar to those a user has interacted with.
Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF): Implements a deep learning model using PyTorch, leveraging embeddings and fully connected layers to capture complex patterns in user-item interactions.
Scalability and Performance
Caching: Implements caching mechanisms to reduce latency by storing frequently accessed data and computations.
Distributed Computing: Utilizes distributed computing frameworks to efficiently process large datasets and improve scalability.
Database Optimization: Optimizes database queries and indexing to enhance data retrieval performance.
Evaluation and Optimization
Evaluation Metrics: Uses metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Mean Average Precision (MAP), and conversion rate to assess the quality of recommendations.
Optimization Techniques: Incorporates A/B testing to evaluate different recommendation strategies and employs online learning to continuously update the model with new data.
Usage
Setup Environment: Install necessary dependencies and libraries.
Data Pipeline: Prepare and preprocess datasets, extracting features for model training.
Model Training: Train the recommendation models, including collaborative, content-based, and neural approaches.
API Deployment: Develop an API to serve recommendations to users in real-time.
