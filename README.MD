# **AI-Powered Recommendation Engine for E-commerce**

This project implements an **AI-powered recommendation engine** for an e-commerce platform using a combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning techniques.

## **Overview**

The recommendation engine is designed to enhance user engagement and increase conversion rates by providing personalized product recommendations based on user preferences and item characteristics.

## **Data Collection and Preprocessing**

- **Datasets:** Utilizes open-source e-commerce datasets such as product reviews and user interaction data.
- **Preprocessing:** Involves cleaning data, handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding text data using TF-IDF. A user-item interaction matrix is constructed for collaborative filtering.

## **Model Development**

### **Hybrid Recommendation System**

1. **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization to uncover latent user-item interactions and predict user preferences.
2. **Content-Based Filtering:** Employs TF-IDF to convert product descriptions into numerical vectors, enabling the recommendation of items similar to those a user has interacted with.
3. **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF):** Implements a deep learning model using PyTorch, leveraging embeddings and fully connected layers to capture complex patterns in user-item interactions.

## **Scalability and Performance**

- **Caching:** Implements caching mechanisms to reduce latency by storing frequently accessed data and computations.
- **Distributed Computing:** Utilizes distributed computing frameworks to process large datasets and improve scalability efficiently.
- **Database Optimization:** Optimizes database queries and indexing to enhance data retrieval performance.

## **Evaluation and Optimization**

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Mean Average Precision (MAP), and conversion rate to assess the quality of recommendations.
- **Optimization Techniques:** Incorporates A/B testing to evaluate different recommendation strategies and employs online learning to update the model with new data continuously.

## **Usage**

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary dependencies and libraries.
2. **Data Pipeline:** Prepare and preprocess datasets, extracting features for model training.
3. **Model Training:** Train the recommendation models, including collaborative, content-based, and neural approaches.
4. **API Deployment:** Develop an API to serve recommendations to users in real time.
